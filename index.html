      <p>Project Overview... The goal of my project was to redesign a responsive web design on the government space agency. Aside from redesign the website had more than needed blank white space on homepage as well as the whole website also some topics was hard to navigate.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">The Problem... The goal for the redesigning the website was the user is visiting the Canadian Space Agency website (CSA) because they wish to gain more information about Space and Canadaâ€™s contributions to Space Exploration. The internet is full of the information and a lot of it is false, So a Government website assures the user that the information is up to date and as accurate as possible. In a World where Space Exploration is primarily dominated by the USA (NASA) and Russia (Roscosmos), the CSA website gives the user information specifically related to Canadian Space Exploration. </p>
